# ü§ù Contributing to Docker MCP Registry

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the official Docker MCP Registry.
This document outlines how to contribute to this project.

## üì¶ Types of MCP Servers

There are two types of MCP servers you can add to the registry:

### üè† Local Servers (Containerized)
Local servers run in Docker containers on your machine. They:
- Require a Dockerfile in the source repository
- Are built and hosted as Docker images
- Run locally with full container isolation
- Can benefit from Docker-built images with enhanced security features (signatures, provenance, SBOMs, automatic updates)

### üåê Remote Servers (Hosted)
Remote servers are hosted externally and accessed via HTTP(S). They:
- Don't require a Dockerfile (already deployed somewhere)
- Use `streamable-http` or `sse` transport protocols
- Often require OAuth authentication
- Have dynamic tool discovery

**If you're adding a remote server,** skip to the [Adding a Remote MCP Server](#adding-a-remote-mcp-server) section below.

## Prerequisites

- Go v1.24+
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/)

## üîÑ Pull request process overview

- Make sure that the license of your MCP Server allows people to consume it. (MIT or Apache 2 are great, GPL is not).
- Fork the repository to your own GitHub account and clone it locally.
- Repository includes a `servers` folder where you should add a new folder with a `server.yaml` inside.
- Repository includes a `cmd` folder with Go code to automate some of the steps.
- Open a PR by ensuring the title and its description reflect the content of the PR.
- Ensure that CI passes, if it fails, fix the failures.
- Every pull request requires a review from the Docker team before merging.
- Once approved, all of your commits will be squashed into a single commit with your PR title.

## üè† Adding a Local MCP Server

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork this repository

Fork the repository to your own GitHub account and clone it locally.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add your entry locally

#### üöÄ Generate your server configuration using `task wizard`

```
task wizard
```

Using the wizard it's the easiest way to create your `server.yaml`, you first need to provide a valid github repo with a Dockerfile, which the wizard will analyze to populate the server default values (you can overwrite them directly in the wizard if you need to).

The wizard allows you to add environment variables, secrets and volumes.

#### üöÄ Alternatively: Generate your server configuration using `task create`

You can use our command to automate the creation of the files. Let's assume we have a new MCP Server to access my org's database. My server's GitHub repo is located at: `https://github.com/myorg/my-orgdb-mcp`

You can call the creation tool passing the category (required), and github url. If your server requires any environment variables, pass them at the end with `-e KEY=value`.

```
task create -- --category database https://github.com/myorg/my-orgdb-mcp -e API_TOKEN=test
```

This will build an image using the Dockerfile at the root of the repository, run it while verifying the MCP server is able to list tools, and then create the necessary files. It will create a directory under `servers` as follows: `./servers/my-orgdb-mcp` and inside you will find a `server.yaml` file with your MCP definition.

```
name: my-orgdb-mcp
image: mcp/my-orgdb-mcp
type: server
meta:
  category: database
  tags:
    - database
about:
  title: My OrgDB MCP (TODO)
  description: TODO (only to provide a better description than the upstream project)
  icon: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/182288589?s=200&v=4
source:
  project: https://github.com/myorg/my-orgdb-mcp
  commit: 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
config:
  description: Configure the connection to TODO
  secrets:
    - name: my-orgdb-mcp.api_token
      env: API_TOKEN
      example: <API_TOKEN>
```

Remember that you need to specify all the env vars that you want to use in your server:

```
task create -- --category database https://github.com/myorg/my-orgdb-mcp -e API_TOKEN=test -e MY_ORG=my-org
```

If you don't specify all the environment variables, users will not be able to configure them properly in the UI.

Also, it's important to notice that env vars and secrets are handled differently. This is how a config block looks:

```
config:
  description: Configure the connection to AWS
  secrets:
    - name: tigris.aws_secret_access_key
      env: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      example: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
  env:
    - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      example: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
      value: '{{tigris.aws_access_key_id}}'
    - name: AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3
      example: https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
      value: '{{tigris.aws_endpoint_url_s3}}'
  parameters:
    type: object
    properties:
      aws_access_key_id:
        type: string
    required:
      - aws_access_key_id

```

This configuration will provide the following UI:

![UI Config Block](assets/img/config-ui.png)

If you want to provide a specific Docker image built by your organisation instead of having Docker build the image, you can specify it with the `--image` flag:

```
task create -- --category database --image myorg/my-mcp https://github.com/myorg/my-orgdb-mcp -e API_TOKEN=test
```

üîí If you don't provide a Docker image, we will build the image for you and host it in [Docker Hub's `mcp` namespace](https://hub.docker.com/u/mcp), the benefits are: image will include cryptographic signatures, provenance tracking, SBOMs, and automatic security updates. Otherwise, self-built images still benefit from container isolation but won't include the enhanced security features of Docker-built images.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run & Test your MCP Server locally

After creating your server file with `task create`, you will be given instructions for running it locally. In the case of my-orgdb-mcp, we would run the following commands next.

```
task build -- --tools my-orgdb-mcp # Not needed if providing your own image
task catalog -- my-orgdb-mcp
docker mcp catalog import $PWD/catalogs/my-orgdb-mcp/catalog.yaml
```

Now, if we go into the MCP Toolkit on Docker Desktop, we'll see our new MCP server there! We can configure and enable it there, and test it against configured clients. Once we're done testing, we can restore it back to the original Docker catalog.

```
docker mcp catalog reset
```

### Avoiding `build --tools` failures

If your MCP server needs to be configured before listing tools, you can now provide a `tools.json` file and the build process will not try to run
the server and list the tools. This is one of the most common issues that block your PR.

This is an example of a `tools.json` file:

```
[
  {
    "name": "tools_name",
    "description": "description of what you tool does"
    "arguments": [
      {
        "name": "name_of_the_argument",
        "type": "string",
        "desc": ""
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "another_tool",
    "description": "description of what another tool"
    "arguments": [
      {
        "name": "name_of_the_argument",
        "type": "string",
        "desc": ""
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

When this file is found next to your `server.yaml`, the `task build -- --tools your-server-name` lists the tools by reading the file instead of
running the server.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Wait for review and approval

Upon approval your entry will be processed and it will be available in 24 hours at:

- [MCP catalog](https://hub.docker.com/mcp)
- [Docker Desktop's MCP Toolkit](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Docker Hub `mcp` namespace](https://hub.docker.com/u/mcp) (for MCP servers built by Docker)

## üåê Adding a Remote MCP Server

Remote MCP servers are already hosted externally and don't require Docker image building. They communicate via HTTP(S) protocols.

### Prerequisites for Remote Servers

- A publicly accessible MCP server endpoint (e.g., `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`)
- Knowledge of the transport protocol (`streamable-http` or `sse`)
- A documentation URL for your server
- OAuth configuration details (if authentication is required)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork this repository

Fork the repository to your own GitHub account and clone it locally.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create your remote server entry using `task remote-wizard`

The easiest way to create a remote server configuration is using the wizard:

```bash
task remote-wizard
```

The wizard will guide you through:
1. **Basic Information**: Server name and category
2. **Server Details**: Title, description, icon URL, and documentation URL
3. **Remote Configuration**: Transport type (streamable-http or sse) and server URL
4. **OAuth Configuration**: Simple yes/no question

If OAuth is enabled, the wizard automatically generates:
- **Provider**: Uses your server name (e.g., `linear`)
- **Secret**: `{server-name}.personal_access_token` (e.g., `linear.personal_access_token`)
- **Environment Variable**: `{SERVER_NAME}_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (e.g., `LINEAR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`)

This will create a directory under `servers/` with three files:
- `server.yaml` - Server configuration
- `tools.json` - Empty array (for dynamic tool discovery)
- `readme.md` - Documentation link

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Review the generated files

The wizard has created all necessary files for you. The `tools.json` file is always an empty array `[]` for remote servers because they use dynamic tool discovery. The `readme.md` file contains your documentation link.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Example remote server structure

Your remote server directory should look like this:

```
servers/my-remote-server/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.yaml      # Server configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools.json       # Always [] for remote servers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ readme.md        # Documentation link (required)
```

Example `server.yaml` for a remote server **with OAuth** (like `servers/linear`):

```yaml
name: linear
type: remote
dynamic:
  tools: true
meta:
  category: productivity
  tags:
    - productivity
    - project-management
    - remote
about:
  title: Linear
  description: Track issues and plan sprints
  icon: https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=linear.app&sz=64
remote:
  transport_type: streamable-http
  url: https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
oauth:
  - provider: linear
    secret: linear.personal_access_token
    env: LINEAR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Example `server.yaml` for a remote server **without OAuth** (like `servers/cloudflare-docs`):

```yaml
name: cloudflare-docs
type: remote
meta:
  category: documentation
  tags:
    - documentation
    - cloudflare
    - remote
about:
  title: Cloudflare Docs
  description: Access the latest documentation on Cloudflare products
  icon: https://www.cloudflare.com/favicon.ico
remote:
  transport_type: sse
  url: https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse
```

**Note:** Remote servers without OAuth don't need the `oauth` field or `dynamic.tools` field in their configuration.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Test your remote server locally

You can test your remote server configuration by importing it into Docker Desktop:

```bash
task catalog -- my-remote-server
docker mcp catalog import $PWD/catalogs/my-remote-server/catalog.yaml
docker mcp server enable my-remote-server
```

For OAuth-enabled servers, authorize the server:

```bash
docker mcp oauth authorize my-remote-server
```

Now you can start the gateway with `docker mcp gateway run` and test tool calls to the remote server.

When done testing, reset the catalog:

```bash
docker mcp catalog reset
```

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Open a pull request

Create a pull request with your remote server files. Make sure to:
- Include all required files (`server.yaml`, `tools.json`, and `readme.md`)
- Verify that your server URL is publicly accessible
- Test OAuth configuration if applicable
- Ensure the documentation URL in `readme.md` is valid
